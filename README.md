# duckywindowspasswordgrabber
a PEN testing script for the rubber ducky that grabs the users login passwords, they will need to be decrypted using NTML method

encode it here I guess: https://ducktoolkit.com/encode#

make sure you fill in the areas of the script that need to be, for example "PASSWORDHERE" and all the others
